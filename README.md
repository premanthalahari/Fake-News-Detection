# üì∞ Fake News Detection - Machine Learning Project

Classify news articles as real or fake using machine learning and deploy your model with Streamlit! This project provides a step-by-step guide to building a text classification system, from preprocessing raw text data to deploying an interactive web application.

## üìå Project Overview
This project uses the [Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) to train a machine learning model for fake news detection. The deployed Streamlit app allows users to input news text and instantly classify it as real or fake.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Text Preprocessing:** Clean and normalize text data (lowercasing, removing special characters, etc.).
- **Feature Extraction:** Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorizer.
- **Model Training:** Test algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and **Random Forest** (best-performing model).
- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Streamlit Deployment:** Interactive web interface for real-time classification.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

üöÄ Usage

Run the Streamlit app locally:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py

üìä Dataset

The dataset contains two CSV files:


True.csv: 21,417 real news articles.


Fake.csv: 23,481 fake news articles.


Key Preprocessing Steps:


Balancing classes (real vs. fake).


Removing stopwords, punctuation, and non-alphanumeric characters.


Stemming/Lemmatization using NLTK.


Splitting data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.


Feature extraction with TF-IDF Vectorizer.


Download the dataset from Kaggle.

### üîç Tips for Customization
1. Replace `YOUR-STREAMLIT-APP-URL-HERE` with your app's live URL.
2. Add screenshots of your app/EDA under the **Deployment** section.
3. Update the **Evaluation Metrics** table with your model‚Äôs actual performance.
4. Include additional preprocessing steps (e.g., lemmatization) if implemented.
